## Intro

A story expansion inspired by the Warcraft universe of Blizzard Entertainment and developed by the Turtle WoW Team. This expansion aims to take a different path from the Burning Crusade, emphasizing the familiar Azeroth of Vanilla WoW over the cosmic battle with the Burning Legion. While being heavily based on the lore from Warcraft 3 and Vanilla WoW, Mysteries of Azeroth seeks to enhance the game by adding content that matches the already well-established lore of Warcraft Universe.

Get ready for a brand-new adventure that will take you on a journey around Azeroth in a new story tailored to provide never-before-experienced adventures.
